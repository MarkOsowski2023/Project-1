## Analysis of Vehicle Sales and Stock Prices vs. The Price of Oil

- Topic and why we chose it
  - Vehicle Stocks (and sales) vs Price of Oil
    - Because EVs and Oil Prices are two of the most debated global topics and news stories right now.
- Initial questions for data (at least 3)
  - Is there a strong correlation between Vehicle Sales and the Price of Oil?
  - Does the correlation change between different subcategories(EVs, Hybrids, Gas) of Vehicles and the Price of Oil?
  - Is consumer setiment correlated with the price of oil?
- Is there a relationship between… ?
  - the price of oil and stock market
- Can we predict… ?
  - the price of stock at a randomly selected price of oil
- What can the data tell us about… ?
  - How strongly the correlation is between the price of oil and different types of vehicle sales
- Initial data sources (at least 2)

## Analysis Results
- Note that when oil prices increased significantly that all stocks went down for all company stocks that were considered. 

-VCAR note that sales for that vehicle started in Dec. 2020

## Analysis and Conclusions
- 6-8 visualizations
- text that explains the story of the visualization
- analytical answers to proposal questions

- Is there a strong correlation between Vehicle Sales and the Price of Oil?
  - The strongest correlation between all stocks analyzed and the price of oil was found when comparing the average price of oil and the average stock price high per month of all stock analyzed combined. Though this was the strongest positive correlation it was not statistically significant. 
- Does the correlation change between different subcategories(EVs, Hybrids, Gas) of Vehicles and the Price of Oil?
- Is consumer setiment correlated with the price of oil?
  - We did not end up pulling data based on consumer surveys as planned therefore cannot directly speak to consumer sentiment beyond what we know about how consumer sentiment has historically effected stock prices.
- Is there a relationship between… ?
  - the price of oil and stock market
- Can we predict… ?
  - the price of stock at a randomly selected price of oil
      - Likely not. The correlation between the two  is not strong enough to predict on this alone. Also, the impact of other events and variables (i.e. Global Pandemics, Changes in trade agreements, etc.) is not addressed directly by such an analysis.
  - When looking at the correlation from 2017-2019 and 2020 to presents, the correlation seems to positively increase from r-score of -.324 to  + .5
 
  - It should be noted that EV Vehicles only recently became accessible to the general public with in the last 10 years. With this in mind, it is possible that as EV's continue to become more popular and available that the correlation between the stock price of major EV production companies and cost of oil will continue to strengthen. We would suggest revisiting this analysis in 2-5 years to re-evaluation the correlation. 
  - Address availability of charging stations, unfrastructure supporting EVs and technology in regards increased positive correlation of stock and oil price


- What can the data tell us about… ?
  - How strongly the correlation is between the price of oil and different types of vehicle sales
